Arslan Lab is a research group led by Dr. Sanem Arslan Yılmaz at the [Computer Engineering Department](https://cse-eng.marmara.edu.tr/),  [Marmara University](https://www.marmara.edu.tr).

Our group focuses on various issues:

- **Fault-Tolerant Computing** – principles, architectures, and techniques for building resilient systems
- **Reliability Analysis of AI/ML Models** – robustness and fault injection studies of machine learning models
- **Machine Learning at the Edge** - TinyML, federated learning, and on-device AI for microcontrollers and embedded platforms
- **High Performance Computing** - parallelization and scalability analysis of scientific applications
- **Computer Architecture** – microarchitecture-level reliability, error detection, and mitigation



We are always looking for motivated graduate/undergraduate students interested in related topics. Please feel free to email [Sanem](mailto:sanem.arslan@marmara.edu.tr)!
